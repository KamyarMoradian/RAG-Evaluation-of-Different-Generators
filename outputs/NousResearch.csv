How accurate are PSA tests in detecting prostate cancer?,"Hi,Thanks for writing in.PSA is a marker for probability of prostate cancer when if shows a particular pattern of increase on consecutive blood tests. It should be remembered that PSA can also be raised in non cancerous situations like infection involving the prostate.The PSA circulates in the blood in two forms either free or bound to certain blood proteins. If you have a high PSA level but a low percentage of free PSA, then close follow up and ruling out cancer becomes important. This test is used for men with a PSA level in the borderline range between 4 and 10. Research shows that if more than a quarter (25%) of the total PSA is free, there is less chance of having prostate cancer. I recommend you also get a free PSA test done to know the risk of recurrent cancer if any.There is no time limit for PSA to rise fro 0.2 to 0.35. However there is PSA velocity which is important and this is calculated as the increases in PSA on a monthly or yearly basis and gives a risk of disease. Please do not worry.","**Accuracy of PSA Tests in Detecting Prostate Cancer**

**Summary of Key Points**

* PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) is a marker for the probability of prostate cancer, but it is not a definitive diagnostic test.
* A rising PSA level on consecutive blood tests can indicate prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated in non-cancerous situations, such as prostate infection.
* The accuracy of PSA tests is influenced by the percentage of free PSA, with a higher percentage indicating a lower likelihood of prostate cancer.
* Research suggests that if more than 25% of the total PSA is free, the risk of prostate cancer is lower.

**Potential Differential Diagnoses**

* Prostate infection (prostatitis)
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
* Prostatitis caused by urinary tract infections (UTIs)
* Prostate inflammation (prostatitis)

**Next Steps or Areas for Further Investigation**

* If a patient has a borderline PSA level (4-10 ng/mL), a free PSA test can help determine the risk of prostate cancer.
* If the free PSA percentage is low (<25%), further evaluation with a digital rectal exam (DRE) and/or prostate biopsy may be necessary.
* If the PSA velocity is"
