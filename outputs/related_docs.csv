Last but not the least is the strict glycemic control that is helpful.Stay blessed and feel free to ask. Will be happy to answer you.

"I can understand your concern. Nano Leo consists of L-arginine and is a good supplement. But with the drugs, you are not maintaining the erection. This could be due to a short duration of action of drugs. Dura plus consists of Dapoxetine and Tadalafil 30/10 and helps to increase the duration of action. If with these drugs the problem is persisting then we can think of changing the prescription. If I was your doctor I would have stopped Nano Leo and would have started tablet Tadalafil 5 mg per day (5 mg is difficult to find and in that case 10 mg every alternate day or half per day). On SOS basis Dura Plus can be used. This will help to solve your problem. Your testosterone levels are normal so no need to get worried."

"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicThe initial symptoms of HIV can vary,some persons have no symptoms, othere may have flu like symptoms.If had protected intercourse then the chance of transmission of HIV is very small.If you wish to be sure that you do not have HIV, then you would need to do testing. This would be the only reliable way to determine if HIV is present.You may also want to consider a full blood count and ESR test. This would determine if you have anemia . The ESR is increased when there is any inflammation in the body which can occur from infection, inflammation, injury, cancer, autoimmune diseases.I hope this helps"
"The symptoms of acute HIV infection appear relatively for a short duration and resolve within a few days. These can appear anywhere around two to six weeks. Your signs at nine weeks could be a coincidental finding, and there could be numerous causes for the symptoms. The tests performed these days for HIV are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. Majority of the people who are infected with HIV develop antibodies by two to eight weeks. The literature says approximately​ 5 % develop by three months. With your negative HIV rapid test at 10 and 15 weeks after exposure, you can surely relax and calm. However, there are recommendations, and I also suggest to my patients to repeat the HIV test at six months of high-risk exposure. I hope your query is answered, but if you still have any other question, please revert."

"Get prostate related test like PSA, prostate smear microscopicaly tested. Get blood sugar tested. Ultrasound of lower abdomen to record prostate size and bladder evacuation status."
"Hi,Thanks for writing in.PSA is a marker for probability of prostate cancer when if shows a particular pattern of increase on consecutive blood tests. It should be remembered that PSA can also be raised in non cancerous situations like infection involving the prostate.The PSA circulates in the blood in two forms either free or bound to certain blood proteins. If you have a high PSA level but a low percentage of free PSA, then close follow up and ruling out cancer becomes important. This test is used for men with a PSA level in the borderline range between 4 and 10. Research shows that if more than a quarter (25%) of the total PSA is free, there is less chance of having prostate cancer. I recommend you also get a free PSA test done to know the risk of recurrent cancer if any.There is no time limit for PSA to rise fro 0.2 to 0.35. However there is PSA velocity which is important and this is calculated as the increases in PSA on a monthly or yearly basis and gives a risk of disease. Please do not worry."
"By your description, it looks like a condition called vernal keratoconjunctivitis. It is a type of allergic condition. It increases in summer and dusty polluted environment. I suggest you wash your eyes with cold filter water twice a day. Also, use Pataday eye drops (Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution) twice a day regularly for as long as you have symptoms. When itching is severe you can use Moxigram LX (combination of Moxifloxacin and Loteprednol etabonate) eye drops 2 hourly or as frequently as itching occurs."
"Minimize the use of steroids as much as possible to avoid side effects such as an increase in eye pressure leading to glaucoma. Both Sterdex (Dexamethasone) and Chibro are steroids. They may relieve your symptoms in the short run but may harm your eyes if used for long term. Pain in the corner should not affect your eyesight. Just use appropriate glasses. For lubricant, you can start with Carboxymethylcellulose containing drops, and it can be changed later if more lubrication is needed. For allergies, Olopatadine containing drops can be used. Keep in touch with your doctor."
