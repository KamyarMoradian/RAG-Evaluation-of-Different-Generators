        "## What is RAG? 🤔\n",
        "We've all used ChatGPT and experienced moments when it starts to generate content that is often incorrect or unrelated to our query. Do you know why this happens? These Large Language Models (LLMs) are not magical entities; they are simply models trained on a vast amount of text. 📚 You could even consider a significant portion of the internet. However, this is not all the data available in the world, because data is not a static concept. You yourself generate some data every day through your use of the Internet, Social Media, and so on. 🌐💻📱\n",
        "\n",
        "So, no matter how much data you use to train your LLM, you always end up encountering new data. This is one of the reasons behind the famous ChatGPT response that tells you it only knows things up to a certain date. 📅 Also, these models tend to hallucinate too. It means they provide incorrect answers but in a very convincing manner. 🎭\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, we have retrieval techniques. Don't worry if it sounds complicated (it actually isn't easy, you may need to take a course to familiarize yourself with these concepts 😅, but that's not necessary for this project), but you use it on a daily basis. You can think of Search Engines (like Google, for example) as a complex form of information retrieval. 🔍\n",
        "\n",
        "So, one day, people came up with this idea that it would be cool if ChatGPT could search Google for us, read the articles for us, summarize what it read, and tell us that. 📖 So, this is not exactly what RAG is, but it's something similar. We have a corpus (a large amount of data) and a query (what a user typed as input). Now, we search through this corpus using techniques related to vectors and vector databases, and find the most similar items in our corpus to the query. Then, we pass these items to an LLM and ask for a structured, well-formatted, user-friendly output. 📈📊"

Initially, I wanted to use this article as the basis for this project, but unfortunately, the llama_index library used in the article seems to be outdated, so most of the code would need to be rewritten. On second thought, I found it more useful to focus on core concepts rather than learning specific libraries. You might want to check out some libraries like langchain or llama_index which provide a lot of tools for RAG. (But not for this project) 📝💡\n",
        "- Don't hesitate to use Google, ask chatbots about any new concepts and terms. If you use search engine-aware chatbots like Microsoft Copilot, they provide links for each part of their answers which is useful if you want to delve deeper into that part. 🌐🤖\n",

        "To create your retriever, you need to use an encoder model. Something like BERT? Nah, BERT is so yesterday. Find something new and shiny! ✨ The basic idea is to encode every document (sentence) in your corpus into a vector space using the same encoder. Then, encode the user query into that same space. With some similarity metrics like dot product, you can find the most similar document to the user’s input and retrieve it. 🎯 You can train your own encoder if you have enough data and resources, 💪 or you can use one of those [ready-made on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=trending), like these ones."

It should be remembered that PSA can also be raised in non cancerous situations like infection involving the prostate.The PSA circulates in the blood in two forms either free or bound to certain blood proteins. If you have a high PSA level but a low percentage of free PSA, then close follow up and ruling out cancer becomes important. This test is used for men with a PSA level in the borderline range between 4 and 10. Research shows that if more than a quarter (25%) of the total PSA is free, there is less chance of having prostate cancer. I recommend you also get a free PSA test done to know the risk of recurrent cancer if any.There is no time limit for PSA to rise fro 0.2 to 0.35. However there is PSA velocity which is important and this is calculated as the increases in PSA on a monthly or yearly basis and gives a risk of disease. Please do not worry.\",\n          \"Hi,Thanks for asking.Your triglycerides are really high and needs to be brought down to less than 150.Non-pharmocologic methods include weight reduction, reduced carbohydrate and bad fat intake along with exercises.

Elevated levels may indicate prostate cancer, though they can also be elevated due to benign conditions or prostatitis.\\n2. **Digital Rectal Exam ( (DRE)**: A physical examination performed by a healthcare provider where the prostate is palpated through the rectum to check for abnormalities such as lumps or hard areas.\\n3. **Ultrasound of the Lower Abdomen**: This imaging technique provides detailed images of the prostate gland, helping to assess its size, shape, and any possible abnormalities. It can also evaluate the bladder's emptying status.\\n\\n#### Potential Differential Diagnoses:\\n- **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( (BPH)**: Often mistaken for early prostate cancer due to similar symptoms and findings on examination.\\n- **Prostatitis**: An inflammation of the prostate that can cause symptoms similar to those of prostate cancer.\\n- **Infection**: Urinary tract infections or other bacterial infections can present with symptoms overlapping those of prostate cancer.\\n\\n#### Appropriate Next Steps or Areas for Further Investigation:\\n1.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Query Similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.03666790401074887,\n        \"min\": 0.7761639952659607,\n        \"max\": 0.941089391708374,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 60,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9051462411880493,\n          0.8168680667877197,\n          0.827297031879425\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Document Similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0799274766813626,\n        \"min\": 0.5747677087783813,\n        \"max\": 0.8743069171905518,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 60,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.658204197883606,\n          0.6054460406303406,\n          0.7291319370269775\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Average Similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04031005675070941,\n        \"min\": 0.7111570537090302,\n        \"max\": 0.8753575086593628,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 60,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.7816752195358276,\n          0.7111570537090302,\n          0.7782144844532013\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Model\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\",\n          \"Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct\",\n          \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Query Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8233869695926183,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 3.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3.0,\n          1.0,\n          2.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Document Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8233869695926183,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 3.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2.0,\n          3.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Average Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8233869695926183,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 3.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3.0,\n          2.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Total Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.9658094464268445,\n        \"min\": 3.0,\n        \"max\": 9.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8.0,\n          7.0,\n          4.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Overall Rank\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8233869695926183,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 3.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2.0,\n          3.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
